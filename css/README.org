Ok, so I really have no idea how to do css, fuck ruby I'm not using
any of the scss/less/*ss stuff under any circumstances.

* Summary of Way to do CSS these days:
** just write css
   I mean its not that bad, and you've not got smartparens in emacs to
   curly braces and cutting and pasting are trivial
** rework
   idk why this is good, but saw a tutorial and there didn't seem to
   be a lot of lines needed to generate the css
** stylus
   this is apparently the more popular tool, I have literally no more
   information on it
